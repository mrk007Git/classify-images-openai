# Gemstone Image Analysis with OpenAI

This project uses OpenAI's GPT-4 Vision API to analyze semi-precious gemstone images and provide structured output in both English and German.

## Features

- Analyzes gemstone images using OpenAI's latest vision model (gpt-4o-mini)
- Provides structured output with:
  - Gemstone name
  - Detailed description
  - Geographic areas where found
  - Confidence level
- Output in both English and German
- Saves individual and combined JSON results
- Generates summary reports
- Creates PDF brochures of analyzed gemstones

## Setup

‚ö†Ô∏è **COST WARNING**: This software uses OpenAI's paid API services. Each image analysis will incur charges to your OpenAI account. See [Cost Information](#cost-estimation) below for details.

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```powershell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Set up OpenAI API Key**
   - Edit the `.env` file
   - Replace `your_openai_api_key_here` with your actual OpenAI API key
   - You can get an API key from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
   - **Important**: Ensure you have sufficient credits in your OpenAI account

3. **Add Images**
   - Place your gemstone images in the `images/` folder
   - Supported format: PNG files

## Usage

Run the analysis:
```powershell
python main.py
```

Generate a beautiful PDF brochure of your analyzed gemstones:
```powershell
python make_pdf_brochure.py
```

## Output

The script creates an `output/` folder with:

- **Individual analysis files**: `{image_name}_analysis.json`
- **Combined results**: `combined_gemstone_analysis.json`
- **Summary report**: `analysis_summary.json`
- **PDF Brochure**: `gemstone_brochure.pdf`

## Output Format

Each analysis includes:

```json
{
  "english": {
    "name": "Amethyst",
    "description": "A purple variety of quartz...",
    "areas_found": ["Brazil", "Uruguay", "Madagascar"],
    "confidence": 85
  },
  "german": {
    "name": "Amethyst",
    "description": "Eine violette Variet√§t von Quarz...",
    "areas_found": ["Brasilien", "Uruguay", "Madagaskar"],
    "confidence": 85
  },
  "image_filename": "IMG_5982_bg_removed.png"
}
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- OpenAI API key
- Internet connection for API calls
